# Fort Blackrock: A Blackrock Prison Cleanup


Clearing out the rubble was hard for the survivors that chose to turn Blackrock Prison into a home for themselves. A fortress in the snowy region of Blackrock, Fort Blackrock is now a large open playerhome with all but 1 jail cell open, a clear main hallway and the canteen originally full of rubble that you have to crouch to get through has been cleared, able to be used for anything a survivor might want. We don't have a palace in The Long Dark but this comes close.

This mod works well with DIY and Betterbases which allows you to clear a lot of  the misc junk that is around on the office floor to truly clean up this home
